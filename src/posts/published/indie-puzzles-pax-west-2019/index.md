I'm headed to PAX West for the first time this year. I put together this list of all the indie puzzley games I'm aware of at the showcase events during PAX weekend. If there are any I've missed, please let me know so I can update the list.

If you're into indie puzzlers like me, definitely check out as many of these games as you can!

## Seattle Indies Expo

Sunday, September 1, 2019</br>
12pm - 9PM

SIX (Seattle Indies Expo) is a free one-day exhibition of the Pacific Northwest’s up and coming indie video games, hosted on PAX Sunday and a short walk from the convention center. At SIX, you’ll get to spend quality time with some of the friendliest game devs around — and of course, crack open a drink and socialize once our after-party starts. What better way to escape the crowds of PAX than with the coolest of indie games?
