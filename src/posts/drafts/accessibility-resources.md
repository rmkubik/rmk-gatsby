I posted an open question on Twitter recently asking for accessibility resources that could help me get a deeper understanding of that world in games. Unexpectedly, I got a ton of helpful links and comments from peers and industry professionals alike! I thought it made sense to catalog these resources in a longer form post like this rather that leave it all in a Twitter thread to be forgotten.

## The Microsoft Accessibility Lab
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility

A large collection of a ton of different products and resources categorized into a lot of different areas of concern. Much of this is specific to settings in Microsoft products. It does seem like a good place to draw inspiration from since there are a wealth of accessibility options burried in these tools. 

Also around the website you can find less product-y reccommendations for things like designing accessible apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/accessibility/accessibility.

## Some Tips in Tweets!
Some great tips on specific accessibility changes you can make:

from @GravPollution
> 1. remove any "twitch" mechanics or anything that relies on pressing buttons super fast or dying.
> 2. No strobe flashes or blinking special effects.
> 3. (on mobile) make the buttons very large, and be very forgiving with double tap or swipes.
> 4. tutorials with audio and written instructions.
> 5. large graphics, with high contrast against the background.
> 6. very soft learning curve that lets player adapt.

This conversation gave some good thoughts on _how_ to go about developing an accesible game. Start sooner rather than later and treat it like the design exercise that it is.

from @GoodfellowIsaac
> keep in mind this is still a *very* developing area of study. But resources like the Microsoft accessibility lab are great. Accessibility is hard because itâ€™s trying to solve sooooo many problems at once and developers / companies want a single solution

from @ryrykubes
> Totally! The MS accessibility lab looks super helpful!
> 
> I was especially curious about gaming specific research, because games tend to have a lot more action and moving parts than other business-y software applications.

from @ianhamilton_
> As well as the greater complexity of input and output and cognitive load the really fundamental difference is that the definition of 'game' requires inaccessibility; to be universally accessible you would need to remove all barriers, all challenge, meaning it's a toy or narrative

from @ianhamilton_
> so what constitutes a reasonable set of accommodations is unique to each game, rather than a fixed universal bar. Which sounds trickier but it's actually nice, means it is a always a design exercise rather than the box ticking you sometimes get in other industries.
